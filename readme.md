Join the discord server for support 

### 1. Config.js
If you change any communication with discord you might break the app.

### 2. Cookies
In order to use the app you will need to get your cookies. To do that install [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BCjson%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E5%87%BA%E5%8A%9B-for-puppet/nmckokihipjgplolmcmjakknndddifde?hl=en) and go to Keydrop.com. 
Then press on the puzzle piece to reveal the chrome extension which is located in the right corner of chrome and press on the extension 
A popup should appear. Press on the blue button named ‘Export cookies as JSON’
That will trigger a download. A file called key-drop.com.cookies.json will be downloaded on your device. Place it in the cookies folder of the app.

However they will not expire while the program is running.
